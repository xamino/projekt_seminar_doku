\section{Setup of the Experiment}

This section describes the way the data was recorded to the best of our abilities.
We'll first look at the hardware and software side of things and then continue on to the actual proceedings that were established to capture the motion data required for the analysis.

\subsection{Equipment}

For our recording we used the "Kinect for Windows"\texttrademark \cite{kinect}, connected to a computer running "Microsoft Windows 7"\textregistered \ via USB.
The Kinect is mounted on a tripod to allow correct positioning.
The weights were applied with a weight-vest with a weight of 5 kilograms.
For the alternate motion, skipping, we also provided a rope.
We used normal tape to mark positions on the floor so that all recordings were made with the same measurements.

\subsection{Software}

We developed our own application for recording the input stream from the Kinect in \CS with "Microsoft Visual Studio 2012" utilizing the "Microsoft Kinect Developer Version".
The program is currently available as open source here \cite{csprogram} and can be seen in Fig ~\ref{fig:programm}.

\end{figure}

Later steps that were based on the recorded data were programmed in MATLAB, available here \cite{matlabprograms}.

\subsection{Workflow}

As the overall workflow of the data from its capture to final results is non-trivial, we have provided a flowchart of the procedure to help understand what code does what when and which data files represent what intermediate results\footnote{TODO: Add flowchart here!}.

\subsection{Composition of the Recording}

Figure \ref{fig:schematic} shows the schematics of the arrangement of the Kinect for the recordings\footnote{TODO: Change figure to have english text!}. The way the Kinect records skeletons proved to be a strong limiting factor in selecting which motions to record as the depth-perception is comparatively poor. The fixed nature of the experiment also limited the motion to one that could be done within a small area, which disclosed for example any form of walking or running.
